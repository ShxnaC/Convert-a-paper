    <h1>Ethics in Plato's Republic</h1>

    <!-- Paper Content -->
    <article>
        <section>
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>In Plato's Republic, Socrates engages in a discussion along with his interlocutors on justice. In one unique exchange, Glaucon places forth a controversy known as the "Ring of Gyges" and argues whether people could act ethically or morally if they have been assured their actions could not be discovered and there would be no consequences. The argument raises several questions, such as whether it makes sense to behave ethically outside of societal pressures and whether ethical conduct might exist without external motivators such as fear of punishment. In this essay, I will argue that regardless of the absence or presence of consequences for one's actions, individuals must act ethically based on universal moral principles that transcend societally constructed norms. </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Plato's Perspective</h2>
            <p>First and foremost, justice is an innate good that brings inner satisfaction. Glaucon argues that individuals only act justly because they fear punishment from society. He believes that if allowed to act unjustly without consequences, people would choose to do so in pursuit of personal gain or pleasure. The people would consider what they are doing to be ethical since what constitutes good is always subjective and mainly varies from person to person. It challenges the idea of inherent ethical behavior and suggests that societal pressure is necessary to determine moral actions. However, Plato countered this argument by distinguishing between two types of good – innate good and acquired good (Plato). According to him, innate goods bring intrinsic satisfaction, while acquired good involves external factors such as reputation or wealth. By this distinction, it is clear that justice is an innate good; it brings inner satisfaction rather than being motivated solely by societal pressures. </p>

            <h2>Kant's Ethical Theory</h2>
            <p>Moreover, Immanuel Kant's theory on ethics provides another perspective on morality outside of societal constraints. Kant believed in universal moral principles based on rationality rather than individual desires (Lacewing 1). From his perspective, specific moral principles are universal, and people should adhere to them regardless of the situation they are in or based on personal benefit. Kant's Categorical Imperative states that everyone should act on a principle that they could also wish to be applied as a universal rule (Lacewing 2), suggesting that one must behave morally regardless of external motivators. In other words, Kant asserts the existence of objective moral duties rooted in reason rather than subjective motives like personal gain or fear. </p>

            <h2>Hobbes' View of Human Nature</h2>
            <p>Finally, at the core of this argument is the question of human nature - it can be argued that human nature, such as empathy and social instincts, highly suggests that some level of innate morality exists. Thomas Hobbes presents a pessimistic view of human nature and morality in his book. He states that without government and societal institutions to control their behavior, humans would act according to their self-interests, which could lead to violence and chaos. According to Hobbes, individuals have no inherent sense of right or wrong; they are motivated by pleasure seeking and avoiding pain (Hobbes 3). However, the arguments ignore certain fundamental aspects of human nature, such as empathy and social instincts, suggesting some level of innate morality exists. These qualities sometimes enable us to put aside personal interests to help someone suffering even when there may be no direct benefit for ourselves. It is also supported by Velasquez who present five different approaches to analyzing ethical issues, including utilitarianism, which emphasizes maximizing overall happiness through rational decision-making (Velasquez et al., 2). This approach highlights how individual actions impact others within society and promotes consideration for others' well-being as a moral duty. In addition, according to Aristotle, everyone strives to achieve happiness through virtuous behaviors since it is part of human nature.</p>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>In conclusion, the "Ring of Gyges" argument raises thought-provoking questions about human behavior and morality. However, after examining different philosophical perspectives, such as Plato's distinction between innate and acquired goods and the influence of societal norms on ethical behaviors, it is clear that individual’s act ethically based on universal moral principles that transcend external motivators. This conclusion is supported by people’s inherent capacity for empathy and social instincts, which suggest an innate sense of morality within us all. Ultimately, acting morally should not depend solely on societal pressures or consequences but be guided by rationality and a sense of duty toward others' well-being.</p>

        <h2>Addendum</h2>
        <p>
            In constructing the HTML document for my assignment, several deliberate choices were made to ensure clarity, readability, and adherence to the MLA formatting guidelines. Firstly, I utilized the '&lt;header&gt;' tag to include essential information such as my name, the course, the professor's name, and the date. This aligns with the MLA requirement of presenting the author's information at the beginning of the document.
        </p>
        <p>
            For the main body of the paper, I chose to use '&lt;section&gt;' tags to clearly delineate different parts of the essay, such as the Introduction, Plato's Perspective, Kant's Ethical Theory, Hobbes' View of Human Nature, and the Conclusion. This not only helps in organizing the content logically but also enhances the readability of the document. Each section is headed with an '&lt;h2&gt;' tag, providing a clear and hierarchical structure to the paper, making it easier for readers to follow the flow of arguments.
        </p>
        <p>
            The use of paragraphs ('&lt;p&gt;' tags) within each section allows for proper text formatting in accordance with MLA style. The first line of each paragraph is indented, consistent with MLA guidelines, ensuring that the document visually aligns with the expected academic standards.
        </p>
        <p>
            The 'Works Cited' section is formatted using an unordered list ('&lt;ul&gt;' with '&lt;li&gt;' items) to list the references. This choice was made because MLA formatting does not require citation numbers, and the unordered list provides a clean and organized way to present the cited works. Each citation is styled to have a hanging indent, which is a specific requirement of MLA formatting.
        </p>
        <p>
            The decision to include a centered '&lt;h1&gt;' tag for the paper's title was made to give prominence to the topic and to distinguish it from the rest of the text. This stylistic choice, while slightly diverging from traditional MLA format, was deemed appropriate for the web format to capture the reader's attention effectively.
        </p>
        <p>
            Lastly, the inclusion of a footer with a script to dynamically display the last modified date of the document is a testament to the capabilities of HTML and JavaScript. This feature, while not a requirement of MLA, demonstrates an additional level of detail and care put into the document's presentation.
        </p>
        <p>
            Overall, each structural decision in this HTML document was made with careful consideration of MLA standards, web readability, and effective presentation of academic content.
